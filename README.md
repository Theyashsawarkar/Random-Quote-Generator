# Random Quote Generator

This project is a web application that generates random quotes from an array of objects of quotes and their authors. It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# How it Works

When the user loads the web page, a random quote is displayed along with the name of the author and the source of the quote (if available). The user can then click the "Show another quote" button to generate a new random quote.

# Getting Started

To run this project locally, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in your web browser.

# Customization

To add or remove quotes, simply edit the quotes array in the script.js file. Each quote object should include the quote and source properties, and optionally the citation and year properties.

#### To customize the styling of the web page, edit the styles.css file as desired.
